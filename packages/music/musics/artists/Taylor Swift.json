cold\n[00:28.623]But something ’bout it felt like home somehow\n[00:32.853]And I left my scarf there at your sister’s house\n[00:37.943]And you’ve still got it in your drawer, even now\n[00:53.690]Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\n[00:59.610]We’re singing in the car, getting lost upstate\n[01:04.616]Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\n[01:08.810]And I can picture it after all these days\n[01:14.653]And I know it’s long gone and\n[01:17.041]That magic’s not here no more\n[01:19.776]And I might be okay, but I’m not fine at all\n[01:25.228]Oh, oh, oh\n[01:30.186]‘Cause there we are again on that little town street\n[01:35.422]You almost ran the red ’cause you were lookin’ over at me\n[01:39.731]Wind in my hair, I was there\n[01:42.177]I remember it all too well\n[01:50.397]Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\n[01:55.497]You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\n[02:00.837]And your mother’s telling stories ’bout you on the tee-ball team\n[02:06.070]You told me’bout your past, thinking your future was me\n[02:10.798]And you were tossing me the car keys\n[02:13.556]**** the patriarchy\n[02:15.409]Keychain on the ground\n[02:17.671]We were always skipping town\n[02:20.889]And I was thinking on the drive down\n[02:23.793]Anytime now he’s gonna say it’s love\n[02:28.001]You never called it what it was\n[02:31.172]Till we were dead and gone and buried\n[02:34.067]Check the pulse and come back swearing\n[02:36.626]It’s the same\n[02:38.457]After three months in the grave\n[02:41.618]And then you wonder where it went to\n[02:44.459]As I reached for you\n[02:46.037]But all I felt was shame\n[02:48.665]And you held my lifeless frame\n[02:52.262]And I know it’s long gone and\n[02:54.719]There was nothing else I could do\n[02:57.276]And I forget about you long enough\n[03:00.076]To forget why I needed to\n[03:07.906]‘Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\n[03:13.043]We’re dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\n[03:17.512]Down the stairs, I was there\n[03:20.031]I remember it all too well\n[03:28.604]And there we are again\n[03:30.736]When nobody had to know\n[03:33.345]You kept me like a secret\n[03:35.776]But I kept you like an oath\n[03:38.150]Sacred prayer and we’d swear\n[03:40.563]To remember it all too well\n[04:03.953]Maybe we got lost in translation\n[04:06.989]Maybe I asked for too much\n[04:09.140]But maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n[04:12.233]‘Til you tore it all up\n[04:14.128]Running scared, I was there\n[04:16.497]I remember it all too well\n[04:24.634]And you call me up again\n[04:27.247]Just to break me like a promise\n[04:29.866]So casually cruel in the name of being honest\n[04:34.978]I’m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n[04:39.295]‘Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[04:45.583]They say “All’s well that ends well”\n[04:48.321]But I’m in a new hell everytime\n[04:52.783]You double-cross my mind\n[04:56.035]You said if we had been closer in age\n[04:59.522]Maybe it would’ve been fine\n[05:02.813]And that made me want to die\n[05:06.417]The idea you had of me, who was she?\n[05:09.180]A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel, whose shine reflects on you\n[05:16.712]Not weeping in a party bathroom\n[05:19.359]Some actress asking me what happened\n[05:21.910]You, that’s what happened, you\n[05:26.921]You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\n[05:32.085]Sipping coffee like you’re on a late night show\n[05:36.992]But then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come\n[05:41.913]And he said it’s supposed to be fun turning 21\n[06:00.768]Time won’t fly, it’s like I’m paralyzed by it\n[06:05.548]I’d like to be my old self again\n[06:08.138]But I’m still trying to find it\n[06:10.592]After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\n[06:15.778]Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone\n[06:21.002]But you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n[06:25.851]‘Cause it reminds you of innocence\n[06:28.724]And it smells like me\n[06:30.737]You can’t get rid of it\n[06:33.430]‘Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n[06:41.620]‘Cause there we are again when I loved you so\n[06:47.038]Back before you lost the one real thing you’ve ever known\n[06:51.342]It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well\n[07:01.692]Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all\n[07:06.719]Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all\n[07:11.838]It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well\n[07:20.999]And I was never good at telling jokes but the punchline goes\n[07:27.143]“I’ll get older but your lovers stay my age”\n[07:32.519]From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\n[07:37.349]I’m a soldier who’s returning half her weight\n[07:42.685]And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\n[07:47.967]Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n[07:53.167]Cause in this city’s  barren cold, I still remember the first fall of snow\n[08:02.172]And how it glistened as it fell, I remember it all too well\n[08:14.075]Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\n[08:24.011]Just between us, do you remember it all too well?\n[08:34.310]Just between us, I remember it all too well…\n[08:45.310]Down the stairs ,I was there ,I was there\n[08:51.310]Sacred prayer , I was there , I was there\n[08:56.310]It was rare ,you remember it all\n[09:00.310]Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there\n[09:05.310]Down the stairs, I was there, I was there\n[09:10.310]Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there\n[09:19.310]It was rare, you remember it, all too well\n[09:22.310]Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there\n[09:28.310]Down the stairs, I was there, I was there\n[09:34.310]Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there\n[09:36.310]It was rare, you remember it, all too well\n[09:43.310]Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there\n[09:48.310]Down the stairs, I was there, I was there\n[09:54.310]Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there\n[09:59.310]It was rare, you remember it，\n",
